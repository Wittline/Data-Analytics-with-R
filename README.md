    ### Looking for extreme of a function/GA tries to find minimum of the function
    #### [Start] Generate random population of n chromosomes (suitable solutions for the problem)
    #### [Fitness] Evaluate the fitness f(x) of each chromosome x in the population
    #### [New population] Create a new population by repeating following steps until the new population is complete
    #### [Selection] Select two parent chromosomes from a population according to their fitness (the better fitness, the bigger chance to be selected)
    #### [Crossover] With a crossover probability cross over the parents to form a new offspring (children). If no crossover was performed, offspring is an exact copy of parents
    #### [Mutation] With a mutation probability mutate new offspring at each locus (position in chromosome).
    #### [Accepting] Place new offspring in a new population
    #### [Replace] Use new generated population for a further run of algorithm
    #### [Test] If the end condition is satisfied, stop, and return the best solution in current population
    #### [Loop] Go to step 2
